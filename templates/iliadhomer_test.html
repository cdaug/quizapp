    <h3>The Iliad, by Homer</h3>

    <p>Do you like war? Do you like super big wars? Do you like history changing wars? Well you will love this book! The Iliad is a book all about the Trojan War. The Trojan War is one of the biggest wars in history, having started the line of Rome, which conquered most of the Mediterranean World. The war started when one of the Trojan princes, Paris, took the Greek Menelaus' wife for his own. In his rage, Menelaus summoned all the Greek leaders to help him siege Troy. They all agreed and then started the long war upon Troy. Many people died in those ten years, but in the end the Greeks were victorious. However they were only victorious because they had been able to trick the Trojans. Building a large horse. they were able to place a small raiding party in the horse while the Trojans dragged it into their city thinking it would protect them. Then the Greeks jumped out and opened the gate of the city for the rest of their army to attack. The only survivors of Troy were Aeneas and his family. Aeneas then went on to found the city of Rome.</p>
    <p>AMAZING BOOK! Sorry but it is that good of a book. The Iliad is one of my favorite books of all time because of how alive it seems through the eyes of Homer. <strong>Ten out of ten Homer. You did it again.</strong>
